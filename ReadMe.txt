SO, for doing this project I done following things:

1)-I created three classes Player, Team, Game
and in each class I created their data memeber and function and constructor

2)-I used scope resolution to wrote the function body for each function, which I 
was declared in class, and with the help of scope resolution I wrote function body
outside the class.

3)-In main function we called these function, In this way we create the whole 
project with object orientaion.
